This application is based on an employee "training" system, where employers can create their own "modules" related to specific processes each employee works through on a normal day of work.

These modules have a hierarchical design where one question is rendered specific to the process being completed, and based on the employees answer to the question, the next question is rendered.

Once application is production ready, there will be a complete dashboard where employers can create these modules, monitor each employee with statistics such as time elapsed to finish each module, as well as edit these modules.
